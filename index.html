   <p> Hello, my name is Besner Carranza
    and I am a current Computer Science student
    at Weber State. Before I attended Weber State, I attended Liberty University in Virginia. 
   </p>
   <p> I am currently serving in the active duty Air Force as a specialized Air Traffic Controller.
     I have been in the Air Force for 3 years.<br>While in the Air Force, I have travelled to multiple states such as: Texas, Mississippi, Arizona, Idaho, and Oklahoma.<br>
    In 2025, I've been tasked to go on a deployment to South Korea for a year. I joined the military for multiple reasons.<br>I wanted healthcare for my family 
and I also wanted a better future for myself and my family.<br> The military has given me the opportunity to attend Weber State and pursue a Computer Science degree for free
and also travel the world.<br> Although my job can be stressful, I am greatful for this opportunity and to serve my country.</p>
   <p> When I have free time, I enjoy playing soccer and spending time with my kids. Before I joined the military, I was playing soccer in Spain
    on a scholorship.<br> I lived in Valencia, Spain for about a year. I was on a full soccer scholorship, playing soccer full time. Growing up, I played soccer for prestigious 
    soccer academies in the United States.<br> Playing for these prestigous academies granted me the opportunity to recieve a scholorship to play in Spain. 
   </p>
   <p> I moved to Utah from South Carolina 2 years ago. I enjoy the beautiful scenery Utah has to offer.<br> I enjoy hiking the mountains with my wife and 2 kids. I also enjoy reffing soccer games 
    during my free time.
