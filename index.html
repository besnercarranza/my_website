<h1> Besner Carranza </h1>
<body>
   <p> Hello, my name is Besner Carranza
    and I am a current Computer Science student
    at Weber State.
   </p>
   <p> I am currently serving in the active duty Air Force as a specialized Air Traffic Controller.
     I have been in the Air Force for 3 years. While in the Air Force, I have travelled to multiple states such as: Texas, Mississippi, Arizona, Idaho, and Oklahoma.
    In 2025, I've been tasked to go on a deployment to South Korea for a year. </p>
   <p> When I have free time, I enjoy playing soccer and spending time with my kids. Before I joined the military, I was playing soccer in Spain
    on a scholorship.
   </p>
   <p> I moved to Utah from South Carolina 2 years ago. I enjoy the 
    beautiful scenery Utah has to offer. I enjoy hiking the mountains with my wife and kids.
